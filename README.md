# 🔧 Maintenance Service Digital Transformation Platform

## 📋 Overview  
An academic group project focused on transforming traditional, informal maintenance services into a structured digital ecosystem using **Odoo ERP**. This system replaces fragmented communication (phone calls, personal contacts) with a streamlined, professional platform that improves efficiency, transparency, and service quality.

## 🎯 Project Mission
To demonstrate how **digital transformation** can revolutionize maintenance services by:
- **Eliminating** chaotic phone-based request systems
- **Replacing** informal personal contacts with structured workflows
- **Implementing** professional service management through Odoo ERP
- **Providing** a scalable model for similar traditional businesses
